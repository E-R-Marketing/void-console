# VOID CONSOLE 🕳️💻

> A black-hole inspired, terminal-style UI where typing ripples space, elements dissolve into stars, and dreams are read as code.

## 🌀 Concept

**VOID CONSOLE** is a creative UI/UX concept that imagines a cosmic terminal interface from a distant future. Inspired by black holes, dream logs, and space-time distortion, everything is written in a single HTML file — no frameworks, just raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
